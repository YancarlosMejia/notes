We generate an output signal and compare it with what the system was expecting. We take this error and pipe it back in to improve the model.

\includepdf[pages=18-20]{slides}
Here we have no signal to compare to so we cannot generate a margin of error to pip back in. Instead we attempt to use another model to generate a better result. This tries to cluster objects.

\includepdf[pages=22-32]{slides}


Basically these lectures were a broad summary, just read the slides.
