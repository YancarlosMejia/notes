\section*{Buddhism in China}
\label{sec:buddhism_in_china}
Buddhism is very focused on otherworldy things while chinese culture is very focused on this world, but for a while it was quite popular.

\paragraph{Arguments Against}
\label{par:arguments_against}
Many people were against the rooting of budhism in china. It was a foreign religion and china was very against anything foreign as barbarian. They received many different buddhist texts that contradicted each other which made it hard to sort it all. The language barrier was another problem. The chinese also felt that buddhism had too much emphasis on non-worldly concepts. They also disliked the notion of karma because it put animals and humans on the same level, they heavily rejected vegetarianism. The heaviest resistance came against the monastic system since chinese culture put so much emphasis on family and children. The chinese felt that the buddhist monks were parasites since they did no work for their food.

\paragraph{Arguments For}
\label{par:arguments_for}
The introduction of buddhism came at a time of great upheaval. Barbarians were common and were quite impressed with buddhism, the felt it could unite their territories. The chinese were also very impressed by the bodhisattva. Life of the peasentry was hard in china so the bodhisattva were attractive. They also like the notion that no matter how low your position you still possessed the buddha nature. Karma was also a welcome idea because it meshed well with confucian ideals because it helped strengthen social order. The translation of buddhist texts gave them more insight into it. Confucianism did not explain life after death so they used the buddhist concepts. Daoist philosophy was already very similar to buddhist ideas so the translation often used daoist term and was used to expand daoist philosophy. They adapted the monastic life as the movement to the monastery as a movement to a new family as the abbot was like a father. The monks started working and producing, this is what allowed the zen tradition to survive persecution(the monestaries were often in isolated areas and self sustaining). Finally buddhist monks in china agreed to bow to the emperor (as opposed to in india where monks were higher).
