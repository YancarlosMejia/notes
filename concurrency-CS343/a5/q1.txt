The time with padding is much higher due to cache thrashing. The addresses are near each other and so pulled into the
same cache line and as each thread increments it the whole line gets mucked with.

The global variables should have close addresses increasing by 64 in order of initialization.

The cast to a void pointer is required when printing so that we can print the address in hex.
