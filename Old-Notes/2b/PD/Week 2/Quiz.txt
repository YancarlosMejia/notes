One quality of a successful project manager is to coach their teammates which Calley does through encouraging the members of the Green Roof Initiative to make design decisions and be involved in the creation process. She also helps to ground in Greyson and delegates work to Sophia well. Much of the work is delegated to the correct departments to encourage everyone to do some part of the process but not give any one group too much responsibility or tasks outside of their skill base. This way everyone involved will have something they are comfortable with to work on. This way the team can gain experience and practice for future projects without being over burdened with work.

Another quality of a successful project manager is scheduling and controlling. This Calley does very well by have a very well laid out plan for the upcoming project. This plan takes many different issues and tasks into mind and accurately delegates work to the various departments and teams in the Green Roof Initiative. The plan also makes accurate estimates to the amount of time and resources needed for each task and allocates that so that every task can be completed in a timely manner and no inter task dependencies leave a department with nothing to do. Everyone in GRI will always have an appropriate task to do and a reasonable deadline to meet.
