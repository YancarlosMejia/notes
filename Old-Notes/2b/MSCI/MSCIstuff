Excel way of finding PW of investment (see Sally and Dave)
-------------------------------------------------------
DONT LEARN
Book way (with taxes) of finding PW if investment 

PW = -x * CTF * y(1-t)(factor) + z*(CSF)*(factor)
x = investment cost
y = revenue from investment
z = disposal revenue from investment (when selling)

CTF = factor that begins tax benefit
