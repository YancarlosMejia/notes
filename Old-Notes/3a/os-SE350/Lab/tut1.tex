Procedures commicate by
\begin{itemize}
    \item allcoate space into envelope
    \item write data to envelope
    \item invoke send message API
    \item invoke receive mesage by other process
\end{itemize}
If there are no messages or process available to read them we store them in a queue. We tie them to the PCB of recieving process.

When you return from an interrupt you dont ahve to return to the same program you left. You can just invoke the scheduler.

Timing service: send a message after a delay which is non blocking. At each tick of a timer we execute a interrupt and look to see if a certain message has been sent and if so it forwards it to the correct process.
