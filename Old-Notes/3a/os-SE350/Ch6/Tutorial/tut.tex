\begin{itemize}
    \item Mutual exclusion (no sharing)
    \item hold and wait (resource is owned)
    \begin{itemize}
        \item require process to request everything at its start and block process until all are granted at the same time
    \end{itemize}
    \item no preemption (ownership cannot be transfered).
    \begin{itemize}
        \item if a process is blocked access have it give up the resources it owns
        \item favor later processes
    \end{itemize}
    \item circular wait
    \begin{itemize}
        \item linear order of resource types
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Problem 6.1}
\begin{itemize}
    \item mutual exclusion (being in intersection): only one car in the intersection at a time
    \item hold and wait: each car is waiting on the car on its right and holding its entrace to the intersection
    \item preemption: cannot move a car out of the way to use intersection
    \item circular wait: each car is waiting on another in a circle
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Problem 6.6}
We get a deadlock pretty clearly with this set up, but if you sort the get statements in alphabetical order will execute without deadlock (linear order property).

\textbf{Problem 6.14}
Yes, if you execute the first statement of each you get a deadlock on S and R. Starvation is however impossible here. Semaphores make it so that they have to alternated executions.
