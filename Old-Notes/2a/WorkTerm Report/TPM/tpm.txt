Uses of Network Protocols
	Over the years the IETF have outlined different standards for the monitoring of data on a network
	Configure devices to send pertinent data for specific events
	Poll data from a specific machine
	network management refers to the activities, methods, procedures, and tools that pertain to the operation, administration, maintenance, and provisioning of networked systems


 What is SNMP?
 	Simple Network Management Protocol
 	Standards based protocol that allows for external monitoring through an agent 
 	most popular in existance

 Pros and Cons
 	Pros:
 		Newer version have increased security measures and encryption
 		Very standardized , bVery well documented (MIBs)
 		Can set traps to prevent the need for constant monitoring (fault handling)
 		configuration is done through a simple config file, can be ported to many devices
 		Accessed through command line, but many GUIs are built on it
		simplistic commands and data formatting
	Cons:
		only version 3 has good security, v1&2 rely on shared secret encryption
		hard to find data and MIBs can be hidden anywhere
		not all devices are supported
		Data is for an instance, so not good for long running processes
		Uses UDP so device can ignore it
		Configuration can be difficult to manage (dont know what data points are configuration)
		require specific devices management, not network wide 


 What is CLI?
 	Command Line Interface
 	Overarching term for the numerous proprietary tools run from the command line 
 	Used for low power machines that cannot support a gui

 Pros and Cons
 	Pros:
 		Provides a large vocabulary of commands and queried, wide range of options
 		entered quickly through command line rather than GIU
 		Easy to understand (commands are more user friendly) text based, designed for humans
 		Device cannot ignore CLI requests
 		Lots of different tools and softwares
 		Can make network wide transactions 
 	Cons:
 		Not as easy to automate	
 		Wider range of data
 		Commands can vary between manufacturers (not as standardized)
 		Commands can vary between the tool used (really not standardized)
 		unpredictable output (result of nonstandardization) makes scripting hard
 		no error management or version control
 		little access control


 
 What is Netconf?
 	operations onto of a Remote Procedure Call (allows a program to cause a subroutine or procedure to execute on another computer) layer using XML encoding
 	The client and the server communicate through secure transfers of xml
 		each has a set schema that describes the syntax constraints

 Pros and Cons
 	Pros:
 		XML makes it easy for a computer to read
 		XML has a short learning curve for humans 
 		Can describe a data structure of arbitrary complexity
 		Allows for transactions (ssuuuuper big deal)
 		Easily deals with partial configurations
 		allows the functionality of the management protocol to closely mirror the native functionality of the device
 		client can discover the protocol extensions supported by the server to adjust its behaviour accordingly
 		can be used wtih XML transformation technologies to automate full and partial configurations

 	Cons:
 		XML is large and can bog down a system
 		lack of standardization of xml schemas
 		not all devices can 



 What is Netflow/IPFix?
 	Routers and switches collect IP traffic statistics on all interfaces and export those statistics as records, to a server that does the actual traffic analysis.
 		does this through use defined flows (unidirectional stream of packets, identified by source and destination IP addresses, IP protocol, source and destination ports , and Type of Service)
 	Implemented on a interface by interface basis to lessen the load
 	created by cisco (ipfix is the attempt to standardize this for all vendors)
 	Ipfix extends netflow to use templates, adds security, allows for sampling to lessen load
 	uses SNMP base

 Pros and Cons
 	Pros:
 		Easy to use and implement
 		data is consolidated on an easy to read report
 			can take only samples to lessen load
		IPFix adds security in data transfer


 	Cons:
 		not available on most products
 		cannot configure devices 
 
 Which is better?
 	Like most technology it all depends on the situation
 		SNMP: good for polling efficient and can gain a lot of data, but difficult to use and data is scattered, good to build GIU's for
 		CLI: more readable syntax for humans, not standardized and tonnes of different ones, good for advanced network admins who want to check on network wide things, use if Netconf isnt avaliable
 		Netconf: very easy to configure on a network, but gets super bogged down with large xml files, good for configuring devices on a network
 		Netflow: good at gathering easy to read data, not always available, good for collecting performance data

 Wrap up
 	These are just four of the protocols used to monitor networks, there are many more existing ones are always evolving 




Notes:
SNMP and CLI have scalability issues
